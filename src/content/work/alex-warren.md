title: 'Alex Warren'
info:
  [
    'Supervoid partnered with breakout pop sensation Alex Warren to design a full visual package for his rapidly escalating headline shows. Going from 300-cap rooms to 10,000-seat venues in just a matter of months, Alex needed a stage production that could scale with his meteoric riseâ€”and fast.',
    "With only 8 days from kickoff to completion, we built bespoke Notch-driven visuals for 12 songs, each one designed to amplify the emotional arc and aesthetic of Alex's performance. We treated live camera shots in real time, transforming them into stylized vignettes that expanded each song's world, giving fans a cinematic experience in every venue.",
    "It was an intense sprint, but the result was a polished, high-impact visual show that matched the energy and ambition of one of pop's fastest-rising stars.",
