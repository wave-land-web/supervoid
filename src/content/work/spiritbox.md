title: 'Spiritbox'
info:
  [
    "Supervoid was hired by Spiritbox to produce visuals for their first headlining tour in support of their album ETERNAL BLUE. The band wanted us to create a unique world for each song, focusing on environmental visuals that seamlessly blended with Lighting Designer Lenny Sasso's cues. Our goal was to transport the audience out of the theater and into an evolving abstract setting that matched the music.",
    'We used cutting-edge tools like Unreal Engine 5 and Notch to develop real-time animations that could be quickly adapted as the arrangements evolved.',
    "Working with a band like Spiritbox that's always pushing the boundaries of their music, we sought to capture their bleeding-edge mentality and create visuals that pushed the boundaries of what's previously been seen at a metal show into something that felt stadium-sized and as massive as the band's music.",
