title: 'Papa Roach'
info:
  [
    'Supervoid was brought on to create visuals for Papa Roach''s "Rise of the Roach Tour." Taking cues from the tour’s dystopian poster art—featuring a masked figure hoisting the band’s flag in a post-apocalyptic wasteland—we built a series of immersive digital environments that served as a gritty narrative extension of themes from across their expansive catalogue.',
    'Utilizing Unreal Engine and Notch, we crafted real-time worlds that integrated seamlessly with the LED screen layout, working closely with the lighting team to ensure each scene amplified the intensity of the live show. For the track "Getting Away With Murder," we developed a custom large language model running on a local server to generate AI-driven imagery of corrupt politicians and financiers, adding a visceral edge to the song''s critique of systemic injustice.',
    'The result was a visual experience that amplified the raw energy of <em>Infest</em>, transforming the stage into a cinematic battleground of rebellion and decay.',
