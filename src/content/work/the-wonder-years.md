    'The Wonder Years brought SUPERVOID on to co-design their 2025 arena run with LD Jaxon Graham.  Utilizing custom set carts that incorporated floral designs to match their banner aesthetic, we built a quickly deployable lighting rig that could roll on and off stage in less than 5 minutes.  With The Wonder Years being hometown heroes of ours, we were incredibly excited to collaborate with them in putting this nimble yet powerful design together.',
