## Overview

[Supervoid](https://supervoid.tv/), [Voyage Productions](https://www.voyagepro.us/), and [Formation](https://formationcreative.co/) created a visual world inspired by [San Holo's](https://sanholo.com/) signature blend of indie, electronic, and future bass for the artist's latest tour.

When beginning their work for [San Holo's](https://sanholo.com/) 2023 tour with [Voyage Productions](https://www.voyagepro.us/) and [Formation](https://formationcreative.co/), [Supervoid](https://supervoid.tv/) knew they'd want to incorporate Notch into a show already brimming with video effects. The singer's large band of multi-instrumentalists, known as “The Food Stamps,” gave the creative team a never-ending stream of great material for the camera to catch.

With the added vision of Creative Director Emily Cox and Art Director [Jamie Issuh](https://www.jamieissuh.com/), Supervoid used Notch to make the show look more visually deliberate and cohesive. They experimented with raw, lived-in textures and techniques, with hand-drawn and mixed-media animation moving at 12 frames per second taking the place of the futuristic 3D particles typical of an arena tour.

The Supervoid team used Notch's Virtual Background feature to, at various points, eliminate the background to keep the focus on a given performer or apply different effects chains to performers and backgrounds. For added contrast, they often kept their backgrounds black-and-white while applying sepia-toned LUTs as well as glow and echo effects to performers.

With final texture overlays and color grading bringing it all together, the creative team used the Disguise GX 3 as their media server. As Notch Designer and Animator Drew Mercadante recalled, “We found the limits fairly early on and optimized to ensure we could get a stable performance. With some creative remodeling, we were able to make it all play nice.”
